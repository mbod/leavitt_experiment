## Leavitt's classic network communication patterns experiments

* This repo aims to implement classic network pattern experiments by Leavitt (1949) for online experiments and using LLMs.

### Goals

* Web socket and simple `flask` setup for running experiments online.
* Allow use of LLMs as individuals in networks
  - all LLMs for simulation tests on the original findings
  - combination of human and LLM participants
